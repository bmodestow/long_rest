## What is *Long Rest*?
Long Rest is a passion project for TTRPG groups to have a streamlined method for planning game nights.
## Why *Long Rest*?
Gone are the days of reaching out to individuals over and over again, trying to plan a game night. With *Long Rest*, you can propse a date and time, and players can simply choose 1 of three options to confirm whether or not they can make it. Additionally, if there are scheduling issues, you can chat with the players in your group to easily figure out a new date. With a date in mind, the calendar is set and players are notified the day of game night!
